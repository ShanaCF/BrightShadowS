Wadile	Snowman Explorer	Amethyst Cave North Side	There's nothing more surprising since we found the Snowman last time.	There's a lot of monsters in this cave, and they all seem to have a treasure with them.	Let's put some mark along our path so we don't get lost in the cave!
Tanshue	Speed Challenger	Amethyst Cave South Side	Does anyone have a spare Millennium Spiritual Crystal?	No matter how many monsters I vanquish, it's only practice.	Is there a shoe that can help me run faster?
Orthy	Silent Iceman	Sacred Hilltop	&^%#$^%#)	
Chaewa	Fencing Champ	Sacred Hilltop	Uhh...	Perhaps my Orthy is like this forever?	Does anyone know how to break the spell on Orthy?
Meshnalt	Tough Explorer	Waterfall Tunnel North Side	I don't want to spend my life looking like a kid!	I will have justice!	I'm lonely... My friends are all gone.
Karistner	Lil' Skater Girl	Waterfall Tunnel South	I want to skate~	Weird. It wasn't hot like this before.	I'm soaked and cold. Horrible cave!
Dai	Sun	Death Valley	The honorable sun~ This is the origin of all!	Someone stole goods from the sanctuary!	I will bring light to the valley like a radiant flame scatters darkness!
Bachelor		Prophet Council	Not starting yet	What will our elders say?	
Bachelor		Prophet Council	When is it going to start?	I'm tired of waiting!	
Elder		Prophet Council	What should I say to the bachelors?	Do you recall?	
Elder		Prophet Council	That was so sudden...	Sigh...
